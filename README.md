Team Blazers - Smart Proctor

Problem it solves:
Cheating in online exams has increased due to AI helpers like InterviewCoder and Parakeet AI, which are hard to detect with traditional proctoring methods.

How it works:
Our Moodle plugin, Smart Proctor, records user keystrokes and special key combinations during tests. These patterns are sent to Cortex Analyst (Snowflake) for analysis, which detects unusual or suspicious behavior and flags it for examiners.

Technologies used:

Moodle Plugin â€“ PHP

Backend API â€“ Flask (Python)

Database â€“ PostgreSQL (to store the Moodle tables)

Containerization â€“ Docker

Cloud & Analysis â€“ Snowflake (Cortex Analyst, hosting Moodle, creating tables)
