Team Blazers – Smart Proctor
🚨 Problem It Solves

The rise of AI-powered helpers such as InterviewCoder and Parakeet AI has made cheating in online exams more sophisticated and harder to detect. Traditional proctoring methods (like webcams and screen monitoring) fail to capture these hidden forms of assistance, putting exam integrity at risk.

⚙️ How It Works

Smart Proctor is a Moodle plugin that strengthens exam security by analyzing keystroke behavior.

It records both normal keystrokes and special key combinations during online tests.

The data is securely processed through Cortex Analyst (Snowflake).

Advanced analysis identifies unusual patterns or suspicious activity, which are then flagged for examiners in real-time.

🛠️ Technologies Used

Moodle Plugin – PHP

Backend API – Flask (Python)

Database – PostgreSQL (for Moodle tables)

Containerization – Docker

Cloud & Analysis – Snowflake (Cortex Analyst, Moodle hosting, and table management)
