# 🚀 Team Blazers – Smart Proctor  

## 📌 Problem It Solves  
Cheating in online exams has become more sophisticated with AI-powered helpers like **InterviewCoder** and **Parakeet AI**.Traditional proctoring methods such as webcam monitoring and screen sharing cannot detect these hidden aids, putting exam integrity at serious risk. ✨ *Smart Proctor helps institutions detect the undetectable, ensuring fair and secure online examinations.*

## ⚙️ How It Works  
**Smart Proctor** is a Moodle plugin designed to ensure exam fairness through **keystroke behavior analysis**.  

1. ⌨️ Records both **normal keystrokes** and **special key combinations** during online exams.  
2. ☁️ Sends data securely to **Cortex Analyst (Snowflake)** for real-time analysis.  
3. 🔍 Detects unusual or suspicious activity patterns.  
4. 🚨 Flags potential misconduct for examiners with actionable insights.
